GenStack.cpp
GenStack.h
main.cpp

Program compiles.
g++ main.cpp
./a.out

Program prompts user to enter file name, reads from file, stores delimiters is stack.  Stack is implemented using code given in class in combination
with original code to create the GenStack.cpp and GenStack.h files.  Limitations: program does not tell user where (if found) the error line is.
Program will sometimes print a double free/corruption error into console upon termination.  This does not affect the functionality of the program as it
only occurs during the programs termination.
